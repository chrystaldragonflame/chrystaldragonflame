Hello, I'm Chrystal Sapphire Dragonflame.

I'm a master's student at Western Washington University studying experimental psychology. 

I'm shooting for a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, and I would like to study the higher order processes responsible for the ability to mentally construct images during visualization.

The current goal of my projects here on GitHub is to learn data visualization and analysis of neuroscience data, specifically EEG data. Once I have achieved that, I want to get started working on some computational neuroscience projects.

If you're interested in my work, or have suggestions on how to improve it, please email me at dragonc@wwu.edu.

Enjoy!
